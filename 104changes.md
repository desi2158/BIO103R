Lab 1 (phylogeny of algae)

- graphing should be review not fresh teaching
- learning outcome that includes quantitative since there’s data
- give data - load into R
- make scatterplot
- emphasize phylogeny to go with lecture
- deemphasize ecology content but keep quantitative part
- make sure homework to reinforce

Lab 2 (mechanisms of evolution)

- Data generation
- how data is entered and formatted
- tidy data learning objective

Lab 3 (evolution data)

- Lab 2’s data
- new: ggplot, legends, 
- time to make plots and think about results
- t test

Lab 4 (Photosynthesis)

- collect absorbance data
- plot absorbance v wavelength

Lab 5 (plant diversity)

Lab 6 (campus plant walk)

Lab 7 (plant structure function)

Lab 8 (growth and differentiation)

- mean, stddev
- repeat t-test
